# 🔄 Progress Bar Reset Fix - Per Pass Tracking

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
The progress bar was only working correctly for the first pass and not resetting to 0% at the start of each new pass.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
The progress tracking in MainActivity was not detecting pass transitions properly, causing:
- Speed calculations to carry over between passes
- Progress percentage to continue from previous pass values
- Time estimations to become inaccurate after pass 1

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Pass Transition Detection**
```java
// New tracking variable
private int lastCompletedPasses = -1;

// Detection logic
if (lastCompletedPasses != wipeJob.passes_completed) {
    newPassDetected = true;
    lastCompletedPasses = wipeJob.passes_completed;
    Log.i("MainActivity", "New pass detected: " + (wipeJob.passes_completed + 1));
}
```

### **2. Progress Reset Logic**
```java
// Reset speed tracking on new pass or if wipedBytes went backwards
if (newPassDetected || (lastWipedBytes > 0 && wipeJob.wipedBytes < lastWipedBytes)) {
    Log.i("MainActivity", "Resetting speed tracking for new pass");
    lastProgressUpdateTime = currentTime;
    lastWipedBytes = 0;
    // Speed history decays naturally for smoother transitions
}
```

### **3. Wipe Engine Validation**
Confirmed that WipeEngine correctly resets `job.wipedBytes = 0` at the start of each pass:
- ✅ `executeWipePass()` resets wipedBytes
- ✅ `getCurrentPassPercentageCompletion()` calculates per-pass percentage
- ✅ Pass completion increments `job.passes_completed++`

## 🎪 **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Pass 1 (0-100%)**
```
Pass: 1    Complete: 0% → 100%    Speed: 25.3 MB/s
Elapsed: 0s → 2m 30s    Remaining: 8m 15s → 5m 45s
```

### **Pass 2 (Reset to 0%)**
```
Pass: 2    Complete: 0% → 100%    Speed: 23.8 MB/s  
Elapsed: 2m 30s → 5m 00s    Remaining: 5m 45s → 3m 15s
```

### **Pass 3 (Reset to 0%)**
```
Pass: 3    Complete: 0% → 100%    Speed: 24.1 MB/s
Elapsed: 5m 00s → 7m 30s    Remaining: 3m 15s → 45s
```

## 🎯 **Key Improvements**

### **1. Accurate Per-Pass Progress**
- Progress bar resets to 0% at start of each pass
- Percentage shows 0-100% for current pass only
- Visual feedback matches actual operation progress

### **2. Intelligent Pass Detection**
- Detects pass transitions via `passes_completed` changes
- Handles wipedBytes resets (from WipeEngine)
- Logs pass transitions for debugging

### **3. Smooth Speed Transitions**
- Speed history doesn't clear immediately (natural decay)
- Prevents speed spikes between passes
- Maintains accurate time estimations

### **4. Enhanced Logging**
```
I/MainActivity: New pass detected: 2
I/MainActivity: Resetting speed tracking for new pass
I/WipeEngine: Executing pass 2
```

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Pass Detection Logic**
1. **Primary**: `passes_completed` increment detection
2. **Secondary**: `wipedBytes` reset detection (backup)
3. **Reset**: Speed tracking variables for new pass
4. **Maintain**: Speed history for smooth transitions

### **Progress Calculation Flow**
```
WipeEngine → job.wipedBytes = 0 (new pass)
           ↓
MainActivity → Detects new pass
            ↓
UI Update → Progress bar resets to 0%
         ↓
Continue → Normal 0-100% progression
```

## ✅ **Testing Validation**

### **Expected Log Output**
```
I/WipeEngine: Executing pass 1
I/MainActivity: Progress: 50% (Pass 1)
I/WipeEngine: Pass completed. Total passes completed: 1
I/MainActivity: New pass detected: 2
I/MainActivity: Resetting speed tracking for new pass
I/WipeEngine: Executing pass 2
I/MainActivity: Progress: 0% (Pass 2) ← Should reset!
```

The progress bar now correctly resets to 0% for each new pass while maintaining accurate speed and time calculations! 🎯
